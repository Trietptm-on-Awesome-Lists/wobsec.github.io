### REFERENCES

Most of these guides are collage of stuff written by me for old projects from OWS, FNF, Telecomix, SRA, Redneck Revolt and recently the GDC. These guides have been up-to-date based on lastest software and system. This is a one-person project so far, helps would be most welcome! :)

This guides will be updated and corrected often.
