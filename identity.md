# Using Contextual Identities

It's always important to be mindful of what you put in cyberspace, but it's especially important when you're trying to stay anonymous. Keep track of which data is attached to each of the identities you create, and make sure that there's not enough overlap to connect them. Make use of the "New Identity" button in Tor Browser between preforming actions under when changing separate identities.

Each piece of information you attach tobring into your identity will reduce the number of possible real identities an attacker has to consider. This includes personal information, like sex (which can halve the number of possible identities) or city (will usually reduce the number by a factor of more than one thousand). It also includes seemingly unimportant information. For example, the weather outside, what kind of camera you use, or something you recently read in real life. Data recorded in pictures you upload can reveal much about you: Tthere are's only so many people that own your model of camera, that are being rained on right now, or that read what you read.

Information may be explicatelyexplicitly revealed by you, or it may be accidentally contained in the data you add. See the following section on metadata for more information on the latter.

There's a few types of identity you might use:

### Your real identity

The identity you use in your everyday life. This is the most important identity you have, as you store your soft, fragile body in it. In person communications tend to be more secure and less persistent than the average online communication, but it's worth noting that the same rules do apply as they would to any other permanent contextual identity. Don't broadcast enough information about your anonymous activities to link you to them.

### Permanent contextual identities

A permanent identity is an identity that you're going to use more than once, but which you don't want to connect to your real identity, and which is pseudononymoustherefor anonymous. This section is going to focus mainly on separating an online identity from your real identity, but should you have more than one permanent contextual identity you should take similar measures to separate them from each other.

You should make and securely store a list of the information which you are going to attach to one of these before you make it. Think like a doxxer and go through the information, narrowing down your identity. For example, say you revealed that you live in a city of one million, that you play hockey on a team, and that you are a mechanic. The pool of real identities starts at a few billion, then is cut down to the few million residents in that city, then to the few thousand hockey players in the city, and then to the tens of mechanics on those teams.

Breaking discipline and revealing something not on the list even once is likely to have a permanent effect as digital communications, even voice communications tend to be recorded and stored forever, so you must be careful. Extending our example, say one day you mention that there was just a major car accident near your house. As you're likely the only person in that pool of ten which meets that criterion, it's has now become possible to dox you.

Don't forget to include any metadata you must reveal under your identity in the list along side the more deliberate data.

### Throwaway contextual identities

By comparison, throwaway identities are much simpler to manage. A throwaway identity is one which you will only use once, for example to quickly look something up. and the importance of what it does are expected to remain minimal, your any actions tis identity reveal about youAs both the information Yyou can simply use it and throw it away by pressing the "New Identity" button.
